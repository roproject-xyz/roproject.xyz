# roproject.xyz
roproject.xyz is exactly like js.org, but for roblox developers and projects.

## Add a domain
I'm currently only accepting requests for github pages, heres the steps you need to follow.

### Step 1
Setup github pages in your repo. Make sure you have some content as I'm not accepting requests for websites with nothing on them. They must be related to roblox.

### Step 2
Now you need to choose a name. This should be similar to your gh pages url (e.g. hello.github.io = hello.roproject.xyz)

### Step 3
Add a `CNAME` file in your gh-pages branch and point it towards your chosen domain.

### Step 4
Open a pull request that adds your domain to `active-domains.json`. Your domain should be live within 48hrs depending on when I add it, I will try to check the PRs daily.

## What am I accepting?
Your project must be related to roblox. I am not giving names out to cafes, hotels, etc. 

## Report a Domain
Please email me here: `report@roproject.xyz`
